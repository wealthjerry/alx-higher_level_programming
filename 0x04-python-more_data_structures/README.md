0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary
This project entails the data structures in python: sets and dictionary. Sets are a collection od unique elements that have unsure order. They do not support indexing and duplication of values, but support functions like add, pop, remove, updaqte, etc. On the other hand, dictionary have keys and values of which keys are immutable and unique.
